# PWA Weather App

This is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to fetch and display weather information based on the user-inputted city name. This project served as a valuable learning experience in building PWAs and utilizing APIs for real-time data.

## Features

- **City-based Weather:** Enter the name of any city, and the app fetches and displays its current weather information.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
